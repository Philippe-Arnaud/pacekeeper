pacekeeper
==========
*Let's do sh%t together*

TL;DR
-----
Pacekeeper is a project of collaborative interoperable document production system entirely based on **Git** and **Markdown**.

why
---
We're producing data.
We're collaboratively producing data.
We're processing data in order to collaboratively produce other data.
We're processing data in order to collaboratively produce other data which can have multiple format.
We're processing data in order to collaboratively produce other data, which can have multiple format, in limited time.

**Therefore**, we need a collaborative processing and production data system which support multiple format support and tasks management.

Such system is yet to invent. Pacekeeper has the ambition to become such system.

At the same time, procrastination is the enemy we're battling against every day and that cannot defeat, once and for all.
Nobody has found a definitive solution to these problems and neither did I.
Nevertheless, several technical patches already exists among which we've tested:

* GTD: TracksGTD, Tiddlywiki, Mgsd
* Wiki: Zim, Wikimedia, Gollum
* Project MGMT: Gnome Planner, MSProject
* Agile: XP, Kanban, Scrum
* Bug Tracking: Trac, Redmine, Mantis
* Word processing softwares: Word, Writer

None of these have completely fulfilled the quest and every one lacked of a crucial function.

who
---
Many people are involved in the data production process.
We can split them in two characters and three classes

* Characters
	* People with no or little technical background who want a system "to work" wherever they are.
	* People with technical background who want a system "to work better"
* Classes
	* People who produce documents
	* People who comment or amend documents
	* People who consume or read documents


We must take care of each of these people in order to succeed.
The system should be able to provide a seamless experience without disruption, despite harsh conditions.
The system should be able to evolve in order to provide a better overall service and evolve in order to address new usages.

**Therefore**, only a **resilient and lightweight**, **fuss-free**, **mobile** and **opened** system is acceptable.

how
---

### Resilient and Lightweight
The collaboration between individuals can't be centralized anymore. The multiples interfaces, gizmos and tools we're using to access data should not rely on a single point of centralized failure. There is no point in collaboration if you're depending on a single entity to deliver the service. By essence such system is vulnerable to attacks and failures that can paralyze the whole activity. Distribution across user is the key to perform even in the event of catastrophic failure.
**Therefore** only a **distributed system** is acceptable.

At the same time, resources are scare and energy is costly. All systems must adapt in order to deliver their service with the least energy consumption possible.  This energy must be spared in terms of computation usage, bandwidth consumption or learning curve.
**Therefore**, only a **modular** system is acceptable.

### Fuss-free
Very few people can learn how to use a new product from scratch whether because of their laziness or because they lack of time. Any new solution provided to non technical people should rely on their current skills and capacity to find crucial functions in less than 2 seconds. All complexity or technical gears of a system must be hidden from their eyes while more skilled expert should be able to use the same system from their preferred interface.
**Therefore** only a **well designed** system is acceptable.

### Mobile
The mobile-centric aspect of our lives has changed everything. Any system that cannot adapt to such usage is meant to decay. Dedicated interfaces, provided by centralized systems are not an option. The mobile technology is moving too fast for heavy-centralized system to adapt. Moreover, such centralized systems tend to lock users out because they're using non-canon tools; which  is a total non-sense. Anyone willing to collaborate must be welcomed with the least requirement imposed on his side.
**Therefore**, **interoperability** is a mandatory requirement for any system to be able to give access to anyone.

In conclusion, a tool-centric approach will definitively fail to answer our needs.
Only a **distributed, modular, well designed, interoperable** approach can provide us an acceptable solution.
